Both doGet and doPost methods are overwritten methods from the HttpServlet Interface that are used to handle data that is transfered
from the client to the server. The way each method handles the data is different for each method. DoGet recieves its data by appending
it to the url which makes it easy for the client to access. The doPost method handles data by appending it to the request or response
objects making it more secure.
